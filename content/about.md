Hey!
My name is Elias Watson.
I'm a guy in my 20's currently living in Greenville, SC, USA.
I have a bachelor's degree in computer science from Bob Jones University.
I'm a programmer, technology/science enthusiast, and a follower of Jesus.

I am interested in almost every topic, including topics outside of technology and science, but my main computer science interests are in game development and computer graphics.
I program primarily in Rust outside of my job, but I have experience in many languages.

_Any opinions I express are solely my own and are not representative of my past, present, or future employers._
