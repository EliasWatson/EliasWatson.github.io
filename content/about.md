Hey there!

I'm Elias Watson, a passionate programmer and technology enthusiast in my 20s, currently residing in Greenville, SC, USA.
I graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science from Bob Jones University.

As a follower of Jesus, I strive to integrate my faith with my love for technology and science.
My main interests lie in game development and computer graphics, but I have a wide range of passions.

I am language agnostic and pride myself on quickly picking up new languages and frameworks.
Here are some of the technologies I have experience with:

- Python
- TypeScript & JavaScript
- C & C++
- Rust
- Lua
- Java
- Lisp

I also enjoy experimenting with more obscure programming languages like Elm, Odin, FORTH, Smalltalk, APL, and more.

Feel free to connect with me or check out my projects!
